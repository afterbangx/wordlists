# wordlists
Just a few simple webdriverio tests that scrape a website for verbs, adverbs, and adjectives and then creates some csv files.

At work, we were using a powershell module that helped create random passwords. 
The module broke because it called out to a site that doesn't exist anymore. 
I wanted to fix the module so that we didn't run into this again. 
I needed a list of words to pull from and didn't like any of the lists that I found so I decided to make my own. 
Rather than do this manually I wrote these webdriverio tests to grab the words for me and create my csv files. 
That is all.
