# wordlists
Just a few simple webdriverio tests that scrape a website for verbs, adverbs, and adjectives and then creates some csv files.

I needed a list of words to pull from and didn't like any of the lists that I found so I decided to make my own. 
Rather than do this manually I wrote these webdriverio tests to grab the words for me and create my csv files. 
That is all.
